Four precocious little Birdies are running a race to the top of the Giraffe's tall neck. Be careful! The giraffe is annoyed and shakes her neck to get rid of those pesky birds!
 
To play: Roll the special die. The player will get â€œForward", "Back", or "Tail".  If "Tail" is rolled, press the Giraffe's tail to shake her neck. The birds who fall off must start all over again. The first bird to arrive at the top of the Giraffe's head is the winner!
